I wanna change a avatar.

And I would program it out.

The original pic is from my Avatar in <a href="https://screeps.com/" target="blank">Screeps</a>

Beautiful,isn't it.

I learned some knowledge about svg today.
So I remake the program to be able to generate both png and svg.
Also, it is better encapsulated now.
